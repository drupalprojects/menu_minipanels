Menu_MiniPanels 6.x-1.2, 2011-01-09
-----------------------------------
All users advised to upgrade from 1.1 and 1.0.

NOTE: (If not already done in 1.1 upgrade) Manual update process required. If
you are upgrading an existing site that uses Menu_MiniPanels, you'll need to
edit and save (without changing options) each menu item that uses a
menu_minipanel to make it work.

Fix issue introduced in last update. Any menu item that didn't have a
  specific element set was broken.
#991246 - Additional fix. Moving minipanel rendering from init to footer,
  broke panels css display, because minipanels were rendered after css had
  already been added to page.


Menu_MiniPanels 6.x-1.1, 2011-01-08
-----------------------------------
NOTE: Manual update process required. If you are upgrading an existing site
that uses Menu_MiniPanels, you'll need to edit and save (without changing
options) each menu item that uses a menu minipanel to make it work.

#997476 - Suggestion from sammo. Add ability to set custom target for the
  minipanel, to enable things like full width drop downs.
#980592 - Not working when using same menu. When the same menu was added on
  the same page (e.g primary links in a block), Drupal.settings was being set
  twice and breaking javascript. Thus add a check if the mlid has already
  been added. This also fixes an issue introduced in previous commit that
  meant minipanels would only work with primary and secondary links.
#945886 - Using the same minipanel for more than one menu item doesn't work.
  This is fixed with some re-engineering to use the mlid in the
  drupal.settings array and panel id. This fix will break existing sites until
  the menu items are edited and resaved. The time required to write an
  automated upgrade path is not justified when a few manual clicks will do.
#945884 - Minipanels that had a system name containing a number weren't
  working because the regex didn't have numbers in the character class.


Menu_MiniPanels 6.x-1.0, 2010-10-16
-----------------------------------
Improved code as a result of a code review by @kiamlaluno.
All sensible qTip configuration parameters implemented.
