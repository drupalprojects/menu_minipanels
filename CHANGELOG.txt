  output variables, etc. This update will require that configurations are
  re-saved to add important extra values; a message is left via hook_update_N()
  when updates are ran, and Watchdog will report errors on each page load until
  the problems are resolved.


Menu_MiniPanels 7.x-1.0-beta4, 2011-07-31
-----------------------------------------
#1230686 by davidwhthomas: Fatfingered the last patch.

Menu_MiniPanels 7.x-1.0-beta2, 2011-01-22
-----------------------------------------
Corrected the spelling of "qTip".
D7 uses the class name 'main-menu' for the main menu UL by default.
Changed to using hook_page_alter() instead of template_preprocess_page() to
  output the menus, seems like the correct option for D7.


Menu_MiniPanels 7.x-1.0-beta1, 2011-01-22
*****************************************
Initial port to Drupal 7.
Changed the module to load the qTip script from sites/all/libraries.
Small optimization - split the JS into two files so less code is loaded for
  most page views.
Don't continue trying to load the menus if the qTip JS file has not been
  installed.
If no Mini Panels are available, show a message on the menu admin page.
Fixed a JS error that would occur if some of the main menu items did not
  contain a minipanel definition.
Changed some labels to be less confusing.
Changed the defaults so that the minipanel shows up underneath the menu,
  rather than on top.


Menu_MiniPanels 6.x-1.2, 2011-01-09
-----------------------------------
All users advised to upgrade from 1.1 and 1.0.

NOTE: (If not already done in 1.1 upgrade) Manual update process required. If
you are upgrading an existing site that uses Menu_MiniPanels, you'll need to
edit and save (without changing options) each menu item that uses a
menu_minipanel to make it work.

Fix issue introduced in last update. Any menu item that didn't have a
  specific element set was broken.
#991246 - Additional fix. Moving minipanel rendering from init to footer,
  broke panels css display, because minipanels were rendered after css had
  already been added to page.


Menu_MiniPanels 6.x-1.1, 2011-01-08
-----------------------------------
NOTE: Manual update process required. If you are upgrading an existing site
that uses Menu_MiniPanels, you'll need to edit and save (without changing
options) each menu item that uses a menu minipanel to make it work.

#997476 - Suggestion from sammo. Add ability to set custom target for the
  minipanel, to enable things like full width drop downs.
#980592 - Not working when using same menu. When the same menu was added on the
  same page (e.g primary links in a block), Drupal.settings was being set twice
  and breaking javascript. Thus add a check if the mlid has already been added.
  This also fixes an issue introduced in previous commit that meant minipanels
  would only work with primary and secondary links.
#945886 - Using the same minipanel for more than one menu item doesn't work.
  This is fixed with some re-engineering to use the mlid in the
  drupal.settings array and panel id. This fix will break existing sites until
  the menu items are edited and resaved. The time required to write an
  automated upgrade path is not justified when a few manual clicks will do.
#945884 - Minipanels that had a system name containing a number weren't
  working because the regex didn't have numbers in the character class.


Menu_MiniPanels 6.x-1.0, 2010-10-16
-----------------------------------
Improved code as a result of a code review by @kiamlaluno.
All sensible qTip configuration parameters implemented.
